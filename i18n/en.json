            "article": "<p>My partner graduated with a DNMADE (National Diploma in Art and Design Professions) in costume design and accessories. As part of her training, during the third and final year, she had to design and create a costume based on a play of her choice. She chose to work on Maurice Maeterlinck's play <i>L'Oiseau Bleu</i> and create the costume for the character of the Light. </p> <p> She wanted the character to be capable of illuminating the stage, revealing elements of the set through shadow play, colored light, and UV light, all thanks to her costume/accessory. So, together, we drafted a specification document for me to designing a system. </p> <p> For the microcontroller, I had several <span>ESP-01</span> modules on hand. Therefore, I proposed controlling the different elements of the dress through a web interface hosted on the ESP. </p> <p> To start, we selected the LEDs to use for the main lighting of the dress. We decided to purchase a strip of warm white <span>5730 LEDs</span>. The LEDs are powered by 12V, and the power consumption depends on the length of the strip used (approximately 20W/m). The LEDs are attached to a corset belt using Velcro. The last row of LEDs is directed downwards using small 3D-printed spacers fixed to a plastic whalebone. </p> <p> For the colored light and UV light, my partner designed flesh-colored gloves in which we could hide small plates topped with LED matrices. The idea was that the gloves could be equipped with either UV LEDs or colored LEDs depending on the scene. For the colored light, we chose <span>addressable WS2812B</span> LEDs. For the UV light, we initially tried a UV LED strip, but the UV light wasn't intense enough, so we bought more powerful individual LEDs, and I assembled a LED matrix myself. </p> <p> To avoid having cables following the actress, we decided to power the system with a battery. I designed two batteries myself, each using 3 <span>Li-ion</span> batteries salvaged from a laptop battery. The three batteries are held in a 3D-printed case with slots designed to press nickel strips against the batteries, avoiding the need for spot soldering. A small circuit board protects the batteries and manages charging and discharging. Thus, we had two rechargeable 12V batteries with a maximum output current of 10A (sized by the battery protection circuit). </p> <p> All the different elements of the system are controlled by an ESP-01 module. The microcontroller is powered by a step-down converter providing the 3.3V required for the operation of the ESP-01 and the addressable LEDs. The ESP-01 has eight pins, and for our project, we used GPIO0 and GPIO2 pins to control the white LEDs and UV LEDs. To be more precise, the ESP controls the opening or closing of a <span>MOSFET</span> robust enough to support 12V and the power drawn by the LEDs. The intensity of the white LEDs is adjustable since we drive the MOSFET with PWM. To control the addressable LEDs, I simply used the Neopixel library from Adafruit. </p> <p> The ESP hosts a small web server with a very simple HTML page. The page includes a slider to control the intensity of the white lights, a slider to control the UV light, and a color picker to choose the color of the colored LEDs. The lights are controlled directly on the dress. The entire system is contained in a 3D-printed enclosure, and all the system's elements are connected using male/female pins to allow for easy installation and removal from the actress.</p>"

I roam through numerous forums in search of the right printer, ultimately I decided to purchase the <span>Prusa I3 Pro B</span> by Geeetech.

I didnt want to use a microcontroller; the task would have had no interest from a hardware or software perspective. I wanted to create a circuit that produces digital data that could be understood and used by a human, to do something practical and beautiful. Still inspired by Ben's videos, I decided to make a clock.</p>             <p>I searched for components to accomplish successive increments paced by the regular oscillation of another component. To count the hours, minutes, and seconds, I simply chose Ripple-carry binary counters. Thanks to 3 <span>CD4024B</span> from Texas Instruments, I was able to encode the hours, minutes, and seconds of my clock using its 7 outputs. The minutes and seconds are represented on 6 bits each, and 5 bits for the hours. To reset the counters, I used quadruple AND gates <span>SN54LS21</span> from Texas Instruments also. When the counter reaches its maximum value, we activate the reset pin thanks to the SN54LS21. For the oscillator, I initially started with a setup using a NE555 as in Ben's video. However, the NE555 lacks precision and stability at such a low frequency. So I opted for a simpler method by dismantling an old broken clock and salvaging its quartz.</p>             <p>Unfortunately, this project never left the breadboard. I didn't have a 3D printer at the time, and I couldn't find a case for the clock that I liked."

This software allows us, board game enthusiasts, to gather around a virtual table (despite the health restrictions in place at the time). While exploring the basic content of the software, I discovered tools and miniatures that could be used to play Dungeons and Dragons. This sparked my interest in learning the rules of this game.</p>             <p> After watching all the seasons of the role-playing series 'Dimension 20' and studying the 'Player Handbook' and the 'Dungeon Master Guide,' I was finally ready to guide my group of adventurers for their inaugural campaign. I quickly realized that taking notes in a notebook would not be sufficient. So, I sought to establish a system that would allow me to organize traces of each gaming session effectively. </p>             <p>                 That's when I discovered Notion. This online tool allowed me to organize my notes into pages and sub-pages, but the most interesting feature is creating a database. Actors, NPCs, cities, clans... all the elements of the campaign and the world I created are stored in a database. This way, both me and my players can easily find information from past campaigns with just a few clicks.</p>             <p>The software 'Tabletop Simulator' is open source and easily customizable with community plugins or with its own Lua scripts. I'm not very familiar with this language, but I still scripted a few features specific to my campaign.             </p>             <p>I recently acquired another Virtual Tabletop software called 'Foundry VTT' which I'm just starting to get the hang of! I switched software because Foundry VTT is specifically made for role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, whereas 'Tabletop Simulator' is a software for board games in general. In Foundry VTT, the logic of the role-playing game is already in place, making it ideal for managing character sheets, adding spells, etc.           </p>             <p> In addition to my virtual campaign, I have also directed and participated in many real-life one-shots. For these games, inspired by the work of Rick Perry for 'Dimension 20' and Julien Mindel for 'La Bonne Auberge,' I wanted to create my own scenery and battle maps. Following tutorial videos on YouTube, I quickly realized that extruded polystyrene was an ideal material for modeling, but the best way to cut it was to use a hot wire cutter.    </p>             <p> Not wanting to spend nearly 100 euros on this type of machine, I decided to make it myself. I had almost everything I needed on hand, except for a nichrome wire. Thanks to an online calculator, I was able to find the right length of wire and the current it needed to cut the foam properly. I used a power supply, whose original function I forgot, and a potentiometer to control the temperature of the nichrome wire.</p>             <p>                 With this machine, I was able to cut several sets of tiles of different sizes and shapes. After texturing and painting them, I was able to create 2 sets of modular tiles to create different battle maps and dungeons. I also used my 3D printer to print decorative elements and the figurines of my characters."

I was very interested in the program offered by the University of Sherbrooke in Canada because it offered a problem-based learning approach in their computer engineering department, a method I hadn't encountered elsewhere.</p>             <p>                 The focus of the semester was a microcontroller based on an <span>ARM Cortex M</span>. We were divided into groups of three, and each working session lasted 2 to 3 weeks with half of the time spent working autonomously.</p>             <p> We were given a problem and a specification document, and we had to develop a solution and present it along with our results at the end of the allocated time. Each session covered different concepts related to embedded systems. To develop solutions, we had to rely on the processor's <span>datasheet</span>, and when we encountered difficulties, we would consult our professor to gain new insights during the next class in order to make progress.            </p>             <p>                 During one session, for example, we had to create an assembly function to send messages via <span>UART</span> and use these functions in a C program. We were not allowed to rely on existing libraries and had to use the datasheet ourselves to determine which register to write to, which flag to rise, and so on.</p>             <p>     In a session on wireless communication, we had to code a program to create a Zigbee network among all the modules. </p>             <p>We also addressed other issues on occasion: <span>serial communication SPI and I2C</span>, <span>real-time programming</span> with the <span>FreeRTOS</span> real-time OS, and multithreading."

We held positions similar as research engineers and were tasked with producing detailed documentation on the project's progress (state of the art, specifications, architecture). Each of us was responsible for a different technology used for counting boxes in a storage warehouse. </p>         <p> After determining the environment in which the system would be deployed, I had to choose the components that make up the system. I decided to opt for the \"low-cost\" option with components that I am familiar with: an <span>Arduino</span> and an <span>Arduino RFID shield</span>. </p>             <p> I coded the software for the Arduino to drive the RFID module via SPI. I also coded a small program in C to communicate with the Arduino and compile the collected data into XML files. </p>             <p> I defined several test plans to collect as much data as possible on the system, with different configurations. In the end, I processed the data using <span>Python</span> and <span>MATLAB</span> to obtain a mathematical model of the system and graphical representations of its performance."

My main limitation was my lack of skills in graphics and rendering. Fortunately, Unity's graphics part is simplified, so it didn't slow down my game development experiments too much.</p>             <p>These experiences with game development allowed me to use existing knowledge for other purposes. I was able to test ideas I had in mind, such as state machines, mechanics for platformers, or turn-based games. </p>             <p>The most complete game I was able to create from scratch is a 2D game where the player controls a little dog that has to perform tasks in a house. For this game, I tried to apply object-oriented programming concepts learned during my studies, including using design patterns like singleton or factory patterns."
